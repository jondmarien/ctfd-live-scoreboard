## 🗡️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jondmarien/ctfd-live-scoreboard.git
cd ctfd-live-scoreboard

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start dev server (proxies API to CTFd)
bun run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` — the Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to `issessionsctf.ctfd.io` automatically.

## 🚀 Deployment (Vercel — Recommended)

1. Push the repo to GitHub
2. Import the project at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Add environment variables in **Settings → Environment Variables** (see [Configuration](#-configuration))
4. Deploy — Vercel auto-detects Vite, installs with Bun, and builds

The included `vercel.json` handles:

- **API proxying** via a catch-all serverless function (`api/[...path].ts`) that injects the auth token server-side
- **Server-side caching** with `s-maxage=30` and `stale-while-revalidate=60` to reduce polling load
- **SPA routing** — all non-API routes rewrite to `index.html`

**Custom domain:** Add your domain in Vercel project Settings → Domains, then create a CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`.

## 🐳 Docker (Deprecated — Supported for Self-Hosting)

> **Note:** Docker deployment is deprecated in favor of Vercel. The Dockerfile is kept for self-hosting scenarios. If using Docker, you'll need to configure the CTFd API token separately (e.g. via nginx proxy headers).

```bash
# Build locally
docker build -t fantasy-ctf-scoreboard .
docker run -p 80:80 fantasy-ctf-scoreboard
```

## 📜 Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `CTFD_API_TOKEN` | Yes | API token for your CTFd instance (private scoreboards) |
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | Yes | Discord channel webhook URL for First Blood announcements |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Yes | CTFd shared secret for webhook validation (Admin → Webhooks) |

**Dev proxy** is configured in `vite.config.ts` — the Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to `issessionsctf.ctfd.io` automatically. No separate config file needed.

## 🩸 First Blood Discord Webhook

When a challenge is solved for the first time, CTFd pushes a **First Blood** event to a Vercel serverless function at `/api/webhook/firstblood`. The function enriches the event with challenge/solver details from the CTFd API and sends a fantasy-themed Discord embed to the configured webhook channel.

### Webhook Setup

1. In CTFd **Admin → Webhooks**, copy the **Shared Secret** → add as `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel
2. Add webhook target: `https://<your-domain>/api/webhook/firstblood`
3. Select the **First Blood** event type
4. CTFd validates the endpoint automatically, then pushes events on first solves
